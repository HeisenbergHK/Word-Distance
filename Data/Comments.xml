My guess is that when you DDoS a hidden service, it would hit the Tor that hosts it way more than the web server behind it and that it would not take much bandwidth, but making lots of connections through different circuits.

Anyways, most relay/hs operators have a tor instance that runs independently on a different machine. &#xA;&#xA;In your case, since your tor is bundled with tbb its configuration files are customized for that. &#xA;&#xA;But that shouldn't stop you from experimenting. The tutorial you were reading is referring to something like [this](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/config/torrc.sample.in). &#xA;&#xA;Feel free to use the file as a reference.

If two Verizon wireless customers on the east coast both connect to the Tor network, is it likely they will both receive circuits terminating at the same exit node? That seems like a problem for anonymity, since it enables you to build a mapping of exit node IP &lt;--&gt; AS numbers. It seems like Tor should be agnostic in assigning circuits to clients? Why should the IP address of a client affect the choice of exit node for its circuit? Does this have to do with guard nodes?" CreationDate="2016-03-24T16:01:40.047" UserId="12224" />

This tool is like nslookup but instead of using a local DNS server, it is doing the lookup over tor. If you do nslookup google.com, you will see the information that your DNS provider has and it will resolve the IP address.  tor-resolve is similar but it works via tor. So if you do tor-resolve google.com, you should get the IP address but your DNS provider won't know that you're doing it because it is via Tor.  If you run in against an onion service, it *should not* work because there is nothing to resolve." CreationDate="2020-03-13T14:15:41.150" UserId="23661" />
